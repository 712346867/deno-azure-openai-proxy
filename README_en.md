**Mapper configuration example**: If you have deployed the GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models on Azure with deployment names 'gpt35' and 'gpt4', respectively, then the mapper should be configured as follows.
```
const mapper:any = {
  'gpt-3.5-turbo': 'gpt35',
  'gpt-4': 'gpt4' 
};
```
   Other map rules can be continued directly in this format.
   
6. Click "save and deploy" to save and deploy the project.
7. Customize your own secondary domain or bind your own domain in the project settings.

# Usage

Fill in your custom secondary domain or bound domain in the GPT API project you're using, select a model that has been set up with a mapper and fill in your own Azure OpenAI key in the API key field to use.
